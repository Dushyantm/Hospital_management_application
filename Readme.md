# Hospital Management Application using JAVA SWING

This application is a platform for people to find medical resource in different city and 
community.  

It also allows the Doctors to diagnose and add Patient Vitals for every Patient encounter. 

User roles are defined to handle particular tasks into 3 major roles:  
1. System Admin  
2. Community Admin  
3. Hospital Admin  

The Admins can perform crucial CRUD operations on various directories.
User validations have been implemented to avoid duplicate entries in the directories by using randomID generator.

Below are shown UML and sequence diagram for the application.
